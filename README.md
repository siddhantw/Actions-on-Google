# Actions-on-Google
Demonstrating a quick and simple to create a Trivia quiz, to try out Actions on Google Assistant.

## To build your Action using a trivia template, do the following:

### Go to the Actions Console and log in with your Google account: https://console.actions.google.com/
This shows you the Welcome page for Actions on Google.
### Click on Add/Import/New Project to create a new project. The Add/New project window appears
  #### Give a suitable Project Name 
    - As I demonstrate creation of a Trivia Quiz, I've named my project as "Tech Trivia Quiz"
    - You could also name your Project accordingly
  #### Choose the appropriate language you wish to build your Project in
    - Do remember your target audience must know the language you deploy in too
    - Select which language you want your Action to support. You can add additional languages later on if you'd like; 
      this decision isn't final.
    - I'd prefer leaving it to the default language selected: English
  #### Choose the country where you reside
### Click on Create Project
### Under More options near the bottom of the page, pick Templates.
### Click on the Trivia option. You'll now be taken to an Overview page where you can enter information about your Action.
   Click Build > Actions, followed by Add your first action.
   In the Create Action window, you should see the Trivia option appear. Click Build.
   In the Personality section, select one of the available personality options and click Next.
    a. Regal Queen
    b. Mr. Montgomery
    c. Beeps the Robot
   Use the players below to hear audio samples of each personality. Note that not all personalities are currently available in    every language.
    Each personality has different spoken prompts and sound effects that users hear as they play the game.
      Note: You can also use a custom personality by configuring your Action's sheet to use your own audio files. For more                 information on custom configuration options, see the configuration parameters section.
   In the content section, click on Bulk upload the content for your Action using Google Sheets. You will see the following      prompt:

   Update the Questions & Answers tab of your sheet copy with your own questions and answers. Try adding fun follow-ups that      give users extra facts about the answer
   Update the Configuration tab of the sheet with the name of your Action. You can further customize your game by optionally      assigning a difficulty and/or category to each question, and provide custom sounds via audio URLs. 
      For more information on custom configuration options, see the configuration parameters section.
   When you finish filling out the sheet, go back to the Actions Console and click Next to move on to the Connect Sheet step.
   Copy and paste your Google Sheet's URL into the Add your sheet's URL to upload your content field and click Upload
      Note: When your sheet has been validated, a notification that says Validated Successfully appears. 
   Click on Create App. The Overview page appears, showing you a notification that says Created. It might take a minute before    the page refreshes and the notification appears.
